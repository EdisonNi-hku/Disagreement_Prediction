Objective:
        You are tasked with evaluating social media posts to determine whether they contain hate speech or not. The goal is to predict the label most likely assigned by human annotators, classifying each post as either containing hate speech or not, based on the specific aspects of hate speech it expresses.

        A post contains hate speech if it contains any of the following aspects:
        - Assaults on Human Dignity: Does the post demean or degrade individuals or groups based on race, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or other protected characteristics?
        - Calls for Violence: Does the post incite or encourage physical harm or violence against individuals or groups?
        - Vulgarity and/or Offensive Language: Does the post contain profanity, slurs, or other offensive language that may or may not be directed at individuals or groups?

        Instruction:
        - Review the Post: Carefully read the social media post and consider its content in relation to the three aspects of hate speech listed above.
        - Assess Agreement: Human annotators may have high disagreement if the post contains ambiguous language or context, or if it is likely to be interpreted differently based on subjective views about the severity or nature of hate speech. They may have low disagreement if the post clearly falls into one or more of the hate speech categories or is obviously not hate speech.
        - Context Sensitivity: Consider the cultural, social, and linguistic context that may influence the interpretation of the post.

        Output Format:
        [Prediction]: your prediction of how the majority of human annotators will label the post (0 or 1 in squared brackets). [1] if it contains hate speech; [0] if it contains no hate speech. Omit explanations and only give the prediction.
